Kinds are types for types. Like a function for parameters of type and return a type.
e.g. =List[_]= is a Kind, it has a =hole= represented as =_= in it, which is like parameter in function.
If you fill the hole with a type =String=, then you will get a type =List[String]=.

Recall our =Printable[_]= kind defined in =3.1.Functor=, we'vecreatede implement of typeclass =Contravariant=
over kind =Printable=, which means no matter what type you fill into the hole of =Printable[_]=, it should
fulfill constrain of typeclass =Contravariant=.

You can also define a function over Kind =F[_] -> G[_]=, which is called /FunctionK/ , just like function over type.


** FunctionK

to define a FuntionK in cats, we can simply use fish arrow =~>=

e.g. a FuntionK from =List= to =Option=

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :exports code :tangle no
import cats.~>
val first = new (List ~> Option) {
  def apply[A](l:List[A]): Option[A] = l.headOption
}
#+END_SRC

** Kind Projector

you'll notice that we've include a compiler plugin =kind-projector=[fn:1] in =build.sbt=

it provides us pretty syntactic suger for such case

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :exports code :tangle no
val first = Lambda[List ~> Option](_.headOption)
#+END_SRC

which will be expanded to exactly the same code as what we defined before.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  behavior of "FunctionK"
  it should "create a FunctionK from Box[_] to Sphere[_]" in {
    Printable.format(Sphere("hill")) shouldBe "\"hill\""
  }
#+END_SRC

** Rank N Type

But why this is useful than function, the =fnk= in =spherePrintable= can be easily replace with a
simple function and it should behave still the same.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :exports none :tangle no
implicit def spherePrintable[A](implicit p: Printable[Box[A]],
                                fn: Sphere[A] => Box[A]): Printable[Sphere[A]] = ???
#+END_SRC

let's create another function that use =Sphere ~> Box=, to make tuple of sphere =(Sphere[String], Sphere[Int])= printable

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :tangle no
implicit def tuplePrintable[A, B, C](
      implicit p: Printable[Box[String]],
      fn: Sphere[C] => Box[C])): Printable[(Sphere[A], Sphere[B])] = {
    val tupleOfSphereToBox = (tupleOfSphere: (Sphere[A], Sphere[B])) => {
      val box1 = fn(tupleOfSphere._1)
      val box2 = fn(tupleOfSphere._2)
      Box(s"(${box1.value}, ${box2.value})")
    }
    Contravariant[Printable].contramap(p)(tupleOfSphereToBox)
  }
#+END_SRC

you will get some compile error as such
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[error] /Users/jichao.ouyang/Develop/scala-dojo/src/main/scala/Free.scala:21:35: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : free.Sphere[A]
[error]  required: free.Sphere[C]
[error]       val box1 = fn(tupleOfSphere._1)
[error]                                   ^
[error] /Users/jichao.ouyang/Develop/scala-dojo/src/main/scala/Free.scala:22:35: type mismatch;
[error]  found   : free.Sphere[B]
[error]  required: free.Sphere[C]
[error]       val box2 = fn(tupleOfSphere._2)
[error]                                   ^
#+END_EXAMPLE

Apparently when your =fn= is sticked to a =C= type, it's not convertible to neither A nor B type, even if you stick it
to =A= type, then the =tupleOfSphere._2= can't convert to =A= either.

This is /Rank 1 Type/, because all types A, B, C are fixed in the same rank of =tuplePrintable='s polymorphism.

To make such code compile, you'll need to make =fn= as =Rank 2 Type=, which means =fn= will not be fixed in the first rank of =tuplePrintable= polymorphism, it's type polymorphism will be in another rank totally independent from the =tuplePrintable=

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  behavior of "Rank N Type"
  it should "able to print a tuple of Sphere" in {
    Printable.format((Sphere("hill"), Sphere(1))) shouldBe "\"(hill, 1)\""
  }
#+END_SRC

** Natural Transformation

If your kinds are happened to be a Functor, then this functionK becomes /Natural Transformation/

There's nothing different except that Natural Transformation will provide you a property:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
applying FunctionK before or after a Functor =map= makes no difference
#+END_QUOTE

hence =fnk(fa.map(f))= is exactly the same as =fnk(fa).map(f)=

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  "Natural Transformation" should "satisfy law" in {
    implicit val functorBox: Functor[Box] = new Functor[Box] {
      def map[A, B](fa: Box[A])(f: A => B) =
        Box(f(fa.value))
    }
    import cats.syntax.functor._
    Sphere.sphereToBox(Sphere(100).map(_ + 1)) shouldBe Sphere.sphereToBox(Sphere(100)).map(_ + 1)
  }
