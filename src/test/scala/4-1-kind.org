Kinds are types for types. Like a function for parameters of type and return a type.
e.g. =List[_]= is a Kind, it has a =hole= represented as =_= in it, which is like paramter in function.
if you fill the hole with a type =String=, than you will get a type =List[String]=.

recall our =Printable[_]= kind defined in =3.1.Functor=, we've create implement of typeclass =Contravariant=
over kind =Printable=, which means no matter what type you fill into the hole of =Printable[_]=, it should
fullfill the constrain of typeclass =Contravariant=.

You can also define a function over Kind =F[_] -> G[_]=, which is called /FunctionK/ , just like function over type.


** FunctionK

to define a FuntionK in cats, we can simply using fish arrow =~>=

e.g. a FuntionK from =List= to =Option=

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :exports code :tangle no
import cats.~>
val first = new (List ~> Option) {
  def apply[A](l:List[A]): Option[A] = l.headOption
}
#+END_SRC

** Kind Projector

you'll notice that we've include a compiler plugin =kind-projector= in =build.sbt=

it provides us pretty syntactic suger for such case

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :exports code :tangle no
val first = Lambda[List ~> Option](_.headOption)
#+END_SRC

which will expand to exactly the same code like what we defined before.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  behavior of "FunctionK"
  it should "create a FunctionK from Box[_] to Sphere[_]" in {
    Printable.format(Sphere("hill")) shouldBe "\"hill\""
  }
#+END_SRC

** Rank N Type

But why this is useful than function, the =fnk= in =spherePrintable= can be easily replace with a simple function
and it should behave still the same with no doubt.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :exports none :tangle no
implicit def spherePrintable[A](implicit p: Printable[Box[A]],
                                fn: Sphere[A] => Box[A]): Printable[Sphere[A]] = ???
#+END_SRC

If your kinds are happend to be Functor, than this functionK becomes /Natural Transformation/
