* Essential Scala Dojo

Most of the examples and exercises are come from underscore's book https://underscore.io/books/essential-scala/

** Up and Running

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sbt
#+END_SRC

Then type =compile= and all deps will download and everything should compile.

** Challenges

All the exercises are well documented and defined in =*Spec= files under =test= folder.
