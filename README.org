* Essential Scala Dojo

Most of the examples and exercises are come from underscore's book https://underscore.io/books/essential-scala/

** Up and Running
Execute the following command so your sbt can download packages in multi threads

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
mkdir -p ~/.sbt/1.0/plugins
echo 'addSbtPlugin("io.get-coursier" % "sbt-coursier" % "1.0.0")' >> ~/.sbt/1.0/plugins/plugins.sbt
#+END_SRC

Run =sbt=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sbt
#+END_SRC

Then type =compile= and wait all deps download and everything should compile.

If everything compiled, try typing in `test` command

** Challenges

All the exercises are well documented and defined in =*Spec= files under =test= folder.

Basically just make the following tests compile and all green...
